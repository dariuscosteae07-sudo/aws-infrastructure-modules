# aws-infrastructure-modules
# This repository serves as a technical sandbox for my journey toward becoming a Cloud & DevOps Engineer.
It contains modular infrastructure, configuration scripts, and documented labs developed during my ASIR studies and AWS Certification path.

## No fluff. Just infrastructure as code and cloud architecture patterns.
